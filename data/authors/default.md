# Hi, I’m Ashwani, the guy behind and front of this site!

I’m a final year undergrad at IIT Patna, who believe in technology and playing around with stuff. I hail from Kanpur(U.P.), India. After years of slogging and hardwork, I finally managed to gain admission to the Indian Institute of Technology, Patna as an undergraduate in Electrical Engineering.

I am passionate about computer science, building things and celebrating the joy of programming. I tend to waste my time reading books, watching movies, TV-series, playing games, hanging out with friends, sleeping and prcrstintng (…).

Apart from programming my other hobbies also include playing football and guitar. I am a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy genre novels.

# Why did you decide to create a blog site?

I create the site based on the principle of: **to share my knowledge** and **to share my hobbies**.

I felt that I needed to expose all of my raw accumulative knowledge in something or somewhere. Making some search on the internet I discover that, to retain **75%** learners need to put into practice what they learned and incredible **90%** learners approximately retain when they teach someone else/use immediately.

In general, to left my footprint on this virtual world, and to bore you all.

# One more thing

You noticed that I’m not an “English native” not even an “Expert”, but I’m writing in English because I want to get better and reach to the fluency. I’ll appreciate if you help me spend your precious time send me your suggestion and correction about my sentences. ;)
